## File Editing Strategies

ACPâ€™s filesystem surface (`fs/read_text_file`, `fs/write_text_file`) only supports whole-file overwrites. In contrast, Codex exposes an `apply_patch` tool that lets the model describe targeted edits as diff hunks. Use `apply_patch` whenever you need partial updates, and reserve `write_text_file` for intentional full rewrites.

## Technical Specifications

[TypeScript](https://agentclientprotocol.com/libraries/typescript): Information on using TypeScript with the Agent Client Protocol, including setup and examples.

[Rust](https://agentclientprotocol.com/libraries/rust): Guidelines for implementing the protocol in Rust, including code snippets and best practices.

[Schema](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/schema): The schema definitions for the Agent Client Protocol, detailing the structure and types used.
